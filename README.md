## Technologies
- ScyllaDB for storing messages, compatible with Cassandra but much faster. Usage is inspired by Discord's usage of the technology. 
- Ory Kratos for auth, a very comprehensive open-source Auth0 competitor.
- Sentry for client-side monitoring, to help find bugs or other issues early.
- Next.JS for the frontend, React with SSR important for SEO and to speed up the initial load.
- Tailwind for styling, eliminating the need to manage stylesheets.
